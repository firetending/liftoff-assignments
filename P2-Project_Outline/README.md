# PROJECT OUTLINE - LIFTOFF (Fall 2022)

## OVERVIEW:
We are developing an application for organizations with medium to large-scale Food Service & Hospitality needs, allowing org admins to easily create menus and manage costs while empowering users to select the meals they are most interested in. The intersection of these functions will improve food cost management by reducing waste, streamline menu creation, and help manage user satisfaction goals.

Admins will develop menus from an existing database of recipes and receive reporting to assist them in short-term and long-term planning. Users can then choose their meal preference and leave feedback on items, to ultimately reduce waste and improve their satisfaction.

### FEATURES
- Admin/User Login: both roles will have accounts to access their defined features, users will have profiles to define payment and dietary preferences/restrictions
- Menu Creation: admins create menus from an external database of options and select the dates they will be available, allowing menus to be edited and reused
- Meal Selection: users can select their preferred meals each day, inspecting each itemâ€™s details (ingredients, nutrition facts, user reviews)
- User Feedback: users can rate/review their food and mark other user reviews as helpful/not-helpful
- Reporting: admins can access reporting on item costs/profits, popularity, and user satisfaction

### TECHNOLOGIES
- Java
- Spring Boot
- MySQL
- JavaScript
- React.js (frontend)

### WHAT WE WILL LEARN
- Frontend: React.js and Redux.js
